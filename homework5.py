"""# Section 1: Exploring Analogies and Other Word Pair Relationships [4 points]
**Background:** Word2vec is a very cool word embedding method that was developed by [Thomas Mikolov et al](https://aclanthology.org/N13-1090/). One of the noteworthy things about the method is that it can be used to solve word analogy problems like:

***man is to king as woman is to [blank]***

The way that it they take the vectors representing king, man and woman and perform some vector arithmetic to produce a vector that is close to the expected answer:

***king − man + woman ≈ queen***

We can find the nearest vector in the vocabulary by looking for argmax *cos(x, king − man + woman)*. Omar Levy has an explanation of the method in this [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-does-Mikolovs-word-analogy-for-word-embedding-work-How-can-I-code-such-a-function) and in the [paper](https://aclanthology.org/W14-1618/).

In addition to solving this sort of analogy problem, the same sort of vector arithmetic was used with word2vec embeddings to find relationships between pairs of words like the following:

"""# Section 3: Creating Word Sense Clusters [96 points]
**Background:** Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks require knowing the sense of polysemous words, which are words with multiple meanings. For example, the word bug can mean:

1. A creepy crawly thing
2. An error in your computer code
3. A virus or bacteria that makes you sick
4. A listening device planted by the FBI

In past research my PhD students and I have looked into automatically deriving the different meaning of polysemous words like bug by clustering their paraphrases. We have developed a resource called [the paraphrase database (PPDB)](http://paraphrase.org/) that contains of paraphrases for tens of millions words and phrases. For the target word bug, we have an unordered list of paraphrases including: insect, glitch, beetle, error, microbe, wire, cockroach, malfunction, microphone, mosquito, virus, tracker, pest, informer, snitch, parasite, bacterium, fault, mistake, failure and many others. We used automatic clustering group those into sets like:

<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-YbbvZ0qwRKPiHZ1ZWOm62dfCkfu4tLJ'>

The clusters in the image above approximate the different word senses of bug, where the 4 circles are the 4 senses of bug. The input to this problem is all the paraphrases in a single list, and the task is to separate them correctly. As humans, this is pretty intuitive, but computers are not that smart. You will explore the main idea underlying our word sense clustering method: which measure the similarity between each pair of paraphrases for a target word and then group together the paraphrases that are most similar to each other. This affinity matrix gives an example of one of the methods for measuring similarity that we tried in our [paper](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/publications/clustering-paraphrases-by-word-sense.pdf):

<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1v1dBzwoSM3S3Y1wDUwqcVBEZ7GxxKKJ4'>

Here the darkness values give an indication of how similar paraphrases are to each other. For instance in this example similarity between *insect* and *pest* is greater than the similarity between insect and error. You can read more about this task in [these](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/publications/clustering-paraphrases-by-word-sense.pdf) [papers](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cdimarco/pdf/cs886/Pantel+Lin02.pdf).

In this assignment, we will use vector representations in order to measure their similarities of pairs of paraphrases. You will play with different vector space representations of words to create clusters of word senses. We expect that you have read Jurafsky and Martin [Chapter 6](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf). Word vectors, also known as word embeddings, can be thought of simply as points in some high-dimensional space. Remember in geometry class when you learned about the Euclidean plane, and 2-dimensional points in that plane? It’s not hard to understand distance between those points – you can even measure it with a ruler. Then you learned about 3-dimensional points, and how to calculate the distance between these. These 3-dimensional points can be thought of as positions in physical space.

Now, do your best to stop thinking about physical space, and generalize this idea in your mind: you can calculate a distance between 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional points, now imagine a point with `N` dimensions. The dimensions don’t necessarily have meaning in the same way as the X,Y, and Z dimensions in physical space, but we can calculate distances all the same.

This is how we will use word vectors in this assignment: as points in some high-dimensional space, where distances between points are meaningful. The interpretation of distance between word vectors depends entirely on how they were made, but for our purposes, we will consider distance to measure semantic similarity. Word vectors that are close together should have meanings that are similar.

With this framework, we can see how to solve our paraphrase clustering problem.

**The Data:**
The input data to be used for this assignment consists of sets of paraphrases corresponding to one of polysemous target words, e.g.

Target	  | Paraphrase set
----------|------------------
note.v    | comment mark tell observe state notice say remark mention
hot.a     | raging spicy blistering red-hot live

(Here the `.v` following the target `note` indicates the part of speech)

Your objective is to automatically cluster each paraphrase set such that each cluster contains words pertaining to a single sense, or meaning, of the target word. Note that a single word from the paraphrase set might belong to one or more clusters.

**Development Data:** The development data consists of two files:

1. words file (input)
2. clusters file (output)

The words file `dev_input.txt` is formatted such that each line contains one target, its paraphrase set, and the number of ground truth clusters `k`, separated by a `::` symbol. You can use `k` as input to your clustering algorithm.

`target.pos :: k :: paraphrase1 paraphrase2 paraphrase3 ...`

The clusters file `dev_output.txt` contains the ground truth clusters for each target word’s paraphrase set, split over k lines:

```
target.pos :: 1 :: paraphrase2 paraphrase6
target.pos :: 2 :: paraphrase3 paraphrase4 paraphrase5
    .
    .
    .
target.pos :: k :: paraphrase1 paraphrase9
```

**Test data:** For testing Tasks 3.1 – 3.3, you will receive only words file `test_input.txt` containing the test target words, number of ground truth clusters and their paraphrase sets. For testing Task 3.4, you will receive only words file `test_nok_input.txt` containing the test target words and their paraphrases sets. Neither order of senses, nor order of words in a cluster matter.

**Evaluation:** There are many possible ways to evaluate clustering solutions. For this homework we will rely on the paired F-score, which you can read more about in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/S10-1011/).

The general idea behind paired F-score is to treat clustering prediction like a classification problem; given a target word and its paraphrase set, we call a *positive instance* any pair of paraphrases that appear together in a ground-truth cluster. Once we predict a clustering solution for the paraphrase set, we similarly generate the set of word pairs such that both words in the pair appear in the same predicted cluster. We can then evaluate our set of predicted pairs against the ground truth pairs using precision, recall, and F-score.

V-Measure is another metric that is used to evaluate clustering solutions, however we will not be using it in this Assignment.

**Tasks:**
Your task is to fill in 4 functions: `cluster_random`, `cluster_with_sparse_representation`, `cluster_with_dense_representation`, `cluster_with_no_k`.

We provided 5 utility functions for you to use:

1. `load_input_file(file_path)` that converts the input data (the words file) into 2 dictionaries. The first dictionary is a mapping between a target word and a list of paraphrases. The second dictionary is a mapping between a target word and a number of clusters for a given target word.

2. `load_output_file(file_path)` that converts the output data (the clusters file) into a dictionary, where a key is a target word and a value is it’s list of list of paraphrases. Each list of paraphrases is a cluster. Remember that Neither order of senses, nor order of words in a cluster matter.

3. `get_paired_f_score(gold_clustering, predicted_clustering)` that calculates paired F-score given a gold and predicted clustering for a target word.

4. `evaluate_clusterings(gold_clusterings, predicted_clusterings)` that calculates paired F-score for all target words present in the data and prints the final F-Score weighted by the number of senses that a target word has.

5. `write_to_output_file(file_path, clusterings)` that writes the result of the clustering for each target word into the output file (clusters file)
Full points will be awarded for each of the tasks if your implementation gets above a certain threshold on the test dataset. Please submit to autograder to see thresholds. Note that thresholds are based on the scores from the previous year and might be lowered depending on the average performance.

"""## 3.2 Cluster with Sparse Representations [26 points]

Write a function `cluster_with_sparse_representation(word_to_paraphrases_dict, word_to_k_dict)`. The input and output remains the same as in Task 1, however the clustering of paraphrases will no longer be random and is based on sparse vector representation.

We will feature-based (not dense) vector space representation. In this type of VSM, each dimension of the vector space corresponds to a specific feature, such as a context word (see, for example, the term-context matrix described in [Chapter 6.1.2 of Jurafsky & Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf)). You will calculate cooccurrence vectors on the Reuters RCV1 corpus. It can take a long time to build cooccurrence vectors, so we have pre-built set called `coocvec-500mostfreq-window-3.filter.magnitude`. To save on space, these include only the words used in the given files. This representation of words uses a term-context matrix `M` of size `|V| x D`, where `|V|` is the size of the vocabulary and D=500. Each feature corresponds to one of the top 500 most-frequent words in the corpus. The value of matrix entry `M[i][j]` gives the number of times the context word represented by column `j` appeared within W=3 words to the left or right of the word represented by row `i` in the corpus.

Use one of the clustering algorithms, for instance K-means clustering in `cluster_with_sparse_representation(word_to_paraphrases_dict, word_to_k_dict)`. Here is an example of the K-means clustering code:

# Recitation
This function is tasked with clustering paraphrases based on sparse vector representations.
We use concept of cooccurence matrix and sparse vector representations

1. Cooccurrence Vectors: Cooccurrence vectors represent how often each word in the vocabulary co-occurs with every other word in a given context window.
Suppose we have the following sentences in our corpus:

* "I like eating apples."
* "Apples are delicious."
* "She bought some apples from the market."
* "The teacher gave us apples as a snack."

Our vocabulary consists of the following words: "I", "like", "eating", "apples", "are", "delicious", "she", "bought", "some", "from", "the", "market", "teacher", "gave", "us", "as", "a", "snack".

The cooccurrence matrix would look something like this (simplified):

|        | I | like | eating | apples | are | delicious | she | bought | some | from | the | market | teacher | gave | us | as | a | snack |
|--------|---|------|--------|--------|-----|-----------|-----|--------|------|------|-----|--------|---------|------|----|----|---|-------|
| I      | 0 | 1    | 0      | 0      | 0   | 0         | 0   | 0      | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0      | 0       | 0    | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0     |
| like   | 1 | 0    | 1      | 0      | 0   | 0         | 0   | 0      | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0      | 0       | 0    | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0     |
| eating | 0 | 1    | 0      | 1      | 0   | 0         | 0   | 0      | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0      | 0       | 0    | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0     |
| apples | 0 | 0    | 1      | 0      | 1   | 1         | 1   | 1      | 1    | 1    | 1   | 1      | 0       | 0    | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0     |


The value at position (i, j) in the matrix represents the number of times word i co-occurs with word j within the context window.

This is an example of sparse vector representation because most of the matrix above is sparse. We are using sparse vector representation from Magnitude:

**coocvec-500mostfreq-window-3.filter.magnitude**: Derived from a co-occurrence matrix based on a corpus like Reuters RCV1.Each dimension represents the count of the word's co-occurrence with one of the top 500 most frequent context words within a window of 3 words.

## 3.3 Cluster with Dense Representations [28 points]

Write a function `cluster_with_dense_representation(word_to_paraphrases_dict, word_to_k_dict)`. The input and output remains the same as in Task 1 and 2, however the clustering of paraphrases is based on dense vector representation.

We would like to see if dense word embeddings are better for clustering the words in our test set. Run the word clustering task again, but this time use a dense word representation.

For this task, we have also included a file called `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.magnitude`, which is filtered to contain only the words in the dev/test splits.

As before, use the provided word vectors to represent words and perform one of the clusterings. Here are some suggestions to improve the performance of your model:

 - Try downloading a different dense vector space model from the web, like [Paragram](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jwieting/) or [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html).
 - Train your own word vectors, either on the provided corpus or something you find online. You can try the skip-gram, CBOW models, or [GLOVE](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). Try experimenting with the dimensionality.
 - [Retrofitting](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/papers/15HLT-retrofitting-word-vectors.pdf) is a simple way to add additional semantic knowledge to pre-trained vectors. The retrofitting code is available here. Experiment with different lexicons, or even try [counter-fitting](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1018).

## 3.4 Cluster without K [31 points]

So far we made the clustering problem deliberately easier by providing you with `k`, the number of clusters, as an input. But in most clustering situations the best `k` is not given. To take this assignment one step further, see if you can come up with a way to automatically choose `k`.

Write a function `cluster_with_no_k(word_to_paraphrases_dict)` that accepts only the first dictionary as an input and produces clusterings for given target words.

We have provided an additional test set `test_nok_input.txt`, where the `k` field has been zeroed out. See if you can come up with a method that clusters words by sense, and chooses the best `k` on its own. You can start by assigning `k=5` for all target words as a baseline model.

You might want to try and use the development data to analyze how got is your model in determining `k`.

One of the ways to approach this challenge is to try and select best `k` for a target word and a list of paraphrases is to use try out a range of `k`'s and judge the performance of the clusterings based on some metric, for instance a [silhouette score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html).

Be sure to describe your method in the Report.

- **Problem 3.4:** Implement `cluster_with_no_k` function [25 points]

# Recitation
**Till now we had been giving K and you used that in K means to split your paraphrase list into list of lists (clusters). Now in this section we dont give you K. For this, Keep logic similar where you were preparing matrix of features. Next step : Try K means using diff number of clusters. Calculate silhouette score for each number and finally chose the optimal no of clusters for that target word**

# Submissions

## Leaderboards [2 points + 3 bonus]
In order to stir up some friendly competition, we would also like you to submit the clustering from your best model to a leaderboard. There will be 2 leaderboards to submit to:
- **Clusters with no K**: Copy the output file from your best model **(has to come from `3.4`)** to a file called `test_nok_output_leaderboard.txt` and include it with your submission in `HW5: Leaderboard Without K` following the format of the clusters file. [1 point]

- **Clusters with K**: Copy the output file from your best model **(has to come from `3.2 or 3.3`)** to a file called `test_output_leaderboard.txt` and include it with your submission in `HW5: Leaderboard With K` following the format of the clusters file. [1 point]

The first 10 places in either of the two leaderboards get 3 extra points.

## Free-response Checklist (check if you missed anything!)
We will look for the following free-responses in your `report.pdf` write-up:
- Section 2: Question responses and analysis of correlations
- Section 3: For each clustering algorithm, you would need to report the `f_score` from the `dev` set and description of your methods.

## GradeScope File Submission
Here are the deliverables you need to submit to GradeScope:
- Write-up:
    - Part 2: answers to questions
    - Part 3: F-scores for clustering algorithms & discussions about your models
- Code:
    - This notebook and py file: rename to `homework5.ipynb` and `homework5.py`. You can download the notebook and py file by going to the top-left corner of this webpage, `File -> Download -> Download .ipynb/.py`
- Leaderboard Results:
  - Leaderboard Without K: `test_nok_output_leaderboard.txt` (Task 3.4 output file)
